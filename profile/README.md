* Amber is a collection of programs that implement biomolecular simulations at the atomic level, primarily through molecular dynamics.
* This collection of repositories is an adjunct to the main Amber site at https://ambermd.org
* Material here is public, but is intended for advanced users, who have already installed the codes at the web page above.
  * Several of the repositories here support the ongoing development of the Amber and AmberTools code bases and are not actually useful for *running* Amber.
  * The applications available in repositories here have value as standalone applications, but are also all included as part of the AmberTools distribution.
